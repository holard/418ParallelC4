# 418ParallelC4

Connect 4(18) aims to parallelize a Connect Four Ai. To run this code, be sure to `make` and then run `a.out`.

## I want to play the AI
Uncomment `playGame()` in the main function of main.cpp, and modify the scorer in `playGame` to be whichever one you want

## I want to run tests
`a.out` can also take different integer depths to test. That is, `a.out 7 9` will run everything on a depth of 7, then on a depth of 9.
